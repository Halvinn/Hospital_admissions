# INTRODUCTION

The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) Inpatient De-identified File contains discharge level detail on patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatments, services, and charges. This data file contains basic record level detail for the discharge. The de-identified data file does not contain data that is protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA. The health information is not individually identifiable; all data elements considered identifiable have been redacted. For example, the direct identifiers regarding a date have the day and month portion of the date removed.

A few questions that might be interesting to help explore the data.
1. What affects hospital length of stay? Type of admission, patient disposition, 
emergency department indicator etc.
2. Are costs for similar procedures different depending in hospital area.
3. How ethnicity or race affect birth weight.
4. Costs over time.
5. Mortality rate vs severity of illness.

These are just a few ideas to help guide the exploratory analysis. 



# Libraries and Data

  `Abortion Edit Indicator` = col_character(),

  `Total Costs` = col_double()))
```

Let's explore the data.

```{r}
dim(discharges)
```
```{r}
head(names(discharges))
```

The dataset has `r nrow(discharges)` records and `r length(discharges)` columns.
The column names have spaces in them which makes working with them a bit cumbersome as quotes have to be used around column names everytime. We can rename the columns by replacing spaces with "_".

## Data Issues 
1. Column names have spaces. Should be replaced with "_". Easier to work with.
2. I record has all entries missing. No explanation found. This record should be deleted.
3. From the data source, records relating to abortions have some information such as
i.e Facility Name, Health Service Area, Hospital County Provider Licese Number etc. 
removed for privacy purposes. We can filter these data into a separate dataframe.
4. A few columns have a lot records missing. For example, `Other_Provider_License_Number` 
column has more than 94% of records missing. This column can be dropped as there is no way to impute the missing data. Other columns with missing data are;
* `Payment_Typology_3`
* `Payment_typology_2`
* `Operating_Provider_License_Number`
* `Length_of_Stay`
5. Zip codes have last two digits removed for privacy purposes. 


### Fixes.
1. Replace spaces in column names with "_".
```{r}
col_names <- str_replace_all(names(discharges), pattern = " ", replacement = "_")
names(discharges) <- col_names
```

2. Drop row with missing info. Identified by missing Facility_Id.
3. Remove abortion-related records.

```{r}
abortion_df <- discharges %>%
    filter(Abortion_Edit_Indicator == "Y")

discharges_clean <- discharges %>%
    filter(!is.na(Facility_Id)) %>% # Row with missing info excluded.
    setdiff(abortion_df)  %>%
    select(-`Abortion_Edit_Indicator`) # Drop Abortion_Edit_Inidcator column.
```

```{r}
filter(discharges_clean, is.na(`Facility_Name`))
```

```{r}
glimpse(abortion_df)
```

We can further clean the abortion_df to drop columns with NA's but I will leave that
for later when I need to use this dataframe.


```{r}
head(discharges_clean)
```


## Explore Missing Data
Let's look at which variables have missing data. Visualizations can be a good way
to quickly communicate results to an audience. Below, I have calculated the 
percentage of missing data for each variable. Most variables have very few 
missing data.

I used the `missmap` function from the [Amelia](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Amelia/vignettes/amelia.pdf) 
package to plot the missingness of the dataframe.

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
sort(sapply(discharges_clean, function(x) sum(is.na(x)) / length(x) * 100), decreasing = TRUE)
```

```{r}
if (!require(Amelia)) {
    install.packages(("Amelia"))
}

library(Amelia)
missmap(discharges_clean, y.labels = NULL, y.at = NULL, x.cex = 0.8) 
```



# Univariate Analysis

In this section, I will explore individual variables to for such attributes as 
distibution, outliers etc. I will rely on histograms, boxplots and density plots 
fot visualiztions.

### Length of Stay

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(discharges_clean, aes(Length_of_Stay)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

p1_scaled <- p1 + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125)) +
    theme_classic()

p2 <- ggplot(discharges_clean, aes(x = 1, y = Length_of_Stay)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    xlab("") +
    theme_classic()

grid.arrange(p1_scaled, p2, ncol = 2)
```


```{r}
summary(discharges_clean$Length_of_Stay)
```

The plots above show that `Length_of_Stay` is left-skewed. Most of the values are 
less tan 15 but there are also a lot of outliers as shown by the boxplot.

One way we can deal with the skewed distribution is by transforming the x scale,
for example by using the log of x instead.

```{r}
ggplot(discharges_clean, aes(log(Length_of_Stay))) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```
